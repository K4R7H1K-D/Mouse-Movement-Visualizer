# üñ±Ô∏è Mouse Movement Visualizer Tool

### OVERVIEW

1. **Parse the coordinate data** - Just paste all your coordinates (x,y format, one per line)
2. **Visualize the pattern** - See what shape or text was drawn
3. **Adjust the visualization** - Change point size, connect points with lines, show grid, change colors
4. **Analyze the data** - Get statistics about coordinate ranges and point count

### **PROCEDURE**:

1. Copy all coordinates from your `.txt` file
2. Paste them into the text area in the tool
3. Click "`Visualize Trail`" to see the pattern
4. Try different visualization options:
    - **Connect Points**: This will show the drawing path
    - **Point Size**: Adjust for better visibility
    - **Colors**: Try different colors for better contrast

The tool automatically **scales and centers** the drawing, so even if your coordinates span a **large range**, they'll fit nicely on the canvas.

Once you **visualize the data**, you should be able to see what was drawn - it could be:

- **Text/letters** spelling out the flag
- A **QR code** or barcode
- **ASCII art**
- **Geometric shapes** forming a pattern
